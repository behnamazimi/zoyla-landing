Capacity planning is predicting how much infrastructure you need. Too little and you crash under load. Too much and you're wasting money.

Load testing turns this from guessing into calculating.

## The basic equation

You need to know three things:

1. How much load you expect ([requests per second](/resources/requests-per-second-explained), [concurrent users](/resources/concurrent-users-explained), whatever metric fits)
2. How much load your current setup handles (from load testing)
3. The gap between them

If you expect 10,000 RPS and your current setup handles 5,000 RPS, you need to roughly double your capacity. Simple math.

The hard part is getting accurate numbers for each piece.

## Measuring current capacity

Run load tests until you find your limits. Not just "it works at this level" but "it breaks at this level."

Your comfortable operating capacity is somewhere below the breaking point. Maybe 70-80% of maximum. You need headroom for traffic spikes and unexpected load.

For finding the breaking point, see [finding your API's breaking point](/resources/finding-api-breaking-point).

## Estimating future load

This is where it gets fuzzy. You're predicting the future.

If you have historical data, extrapolate. Traffic grew 20% last year, expect similar growth. Seasonal patterns repeat.

If you're launching something new, estimate conservatively. Then add margin. Then add more margin. New launches are unpredictable.

If you have a specific event — product launch, marketing campaign, expected viral moment — estimate the peak load, not the average.

## Scaling math

If your system scales linearly, doubling resources doubles capacity. This is often roughly true for horizontal scaling — twice the servers, twice the throughput.

But not always. Database bottlenecks don't scale linearly. Shared resources become contention points. Some architectures have scaling cliffs.

Test at different scales to understand your scaling curve. If 2 servers handle 1000 RPS and 4 servers handle 1800 RPS (not 2000), you know scaling isn't linear.

## The cost tradeoff

More capacity costs more money. Less capacity risks outages.

The right balance depends on your situation. A consumer app might tolerate occasional slowdowns. A financial system might not.

Calculate the cost of under-provisioning (lost revenue, reputation damage, SLA penalties) versus over-provisioning (wasted infrastructure spend). Make an informed decision.

## Auto-scaling considerations

Cloud platforms offer auto-scaling. Capacity adjusts to load automatically. Problem solved?

Not quite. Auto-scaling has lag. Traffic spikes faster than new instances spin up. You still need baseline capacity to handle initial surges.

Load test your auto-scaling. Simulate traffic spikes and measure how quickly capacity adjusts. If it takes 5 minutes to scale up and your traffic spike lasts 2 minutes, auto-scaling won't help.

## Planning horizons

Short-term: do you have enough capacity for the next traffic event? The holiday sale, the product launch, the marketing push.

Medium-term: do you have enough for the next quarter? Factor in expected growth.

Long-term: what's your scaling strategy for the next year? When do you need architectural changes versus just adding servers?

Different horizons need different planning approaches.

## The capacity planning document

Write down your numbers:

- Current capacity (from load testing)
- Current usage (from production monitoring)
- Headroom (capacity minus usage)
- Expected growth rate
- Planned events that might spike traffic
- Trigger points for scaling decisions

Review periodically. Update after major changes. Use it for budget planning.

## When to scale

Don't wait until you're at capacity. Scale when you're approaching it.

If you're at 80% capacity and growing 10% monthly, you'll hit limits in 2 months. Start the scaling process now.

For more on tracking this over time, see [setting performance baselines](/resources/performance-baselines).

## The practical approach

1. Load test to find current capacity
2. Monitor production to know current usage
3. Estimate future load based on growth and events
4. Calculate the gap
5. Plan scaling to close the gap before you need it

That's capacity planning. Not guessing. Calculating. The [testing before launch](/resources/testing-before-launch) checklist shows how to apply this before major releases.
