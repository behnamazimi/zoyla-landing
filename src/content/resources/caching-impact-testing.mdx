Everyone says caching improves performance. But by how much? And for your specific application? The only way to know is to measure.

Caching can be transformative. A request that takes 500ms from the database might take 5ms from cache. That's 100x faster. But it can also be irrelevant — if your cache hit rate is 10%, you're not getting much benefit.

## Testing cache impact

The basic approach: test with caching disabled, then test with caching enabled. Compare.

This sounds simple. It's slightly more nuanced in practice.

**Cold cache test** — start with an empty cache. Run your load test. This shows worst-case performance and measures how quickly the cache warms up.

**Warm cache test** — pre-populate the cache with realistic data. Run your load test. This shows best-case performance with good cache hit rates.

**Mixed test** — start cold, run long enough for the cache to warm up, observe the transition. This is often most realistic.

## What to measure

**Response time difference** — how much faster are cached responses? If cold is 500ms and warm is 50ms, caching is saving 450ms per hit.

**Cache hit rate** — what percentage of requests are served from cache? 90% hit rate with 450ms savings means average savings of 405ms.

**Throughput difference** — can you handle more requests with caching? Faster responses mean connections free up sooner.

**Resource usage** — does caching reduce database load? CPU usage? This matters for capacity planning.

## The hit rate question

Cache hit rate depends on your access patterns. If users request the same data repeatedly, hit rates are high. If every request is unique, caching doesn't help.

Test with realistic access patterns. If production traffic hits the same 1000 items 80% of the time, your test should reflect that.

Testing with purely random access gives you pessimistic results. Testing with the same item every time gives you optimistic results. Neither is accurate.

## Cache warming strategies

If your cache is empty at startup, the first users after a deploy get slow responses. This might be acceptable. Or it might not.

Options:

**Accept cold starts** — first requests are slow, then things improve. Simple but potentially bad UX.

**Pre-warm the cache** — on startup, populate the cache with common data before accepting traffic.

**Gradual rollout** — shift traffic slowly to new instances so the cache warms up under light load.

Load testing can validate these strategies. Test a cold start under full load. If it's unacceptable, test your warming approach.

## Cache invalidation testing

Caching introduces staleness. When data changes, the cache might still have old values.

Test your invalidation logic under load. Update data and verify cached responses update appropriately. Race conditions and timing issues often only appear under concurrent load.

## Measuring cache overhead

Caching isn't free. Cache lookups take time. Cache storage uses memory. Network round trips to external cache servers add latency.

For very fast operations, caching might actually slow things down. If your database query takes 1ms and your cache lookup takes 2ms, caching hurts.

Test both paths. If cached responses aren't significantly faster than uncached, reconsider your caching strategy.

## Zoyla for cache testing

Run a test with cold cache, note the results. Warm the cache. Run the same test again. Compare.

The visual comparison makes the difference obvious. You'll see response times drop, throughput increase, the whole picture.

## The practical takeaway

Don't assume caching helps. Measure it. The impact varies wildly based on your data, your access patterns, your cache configuration.

Test cold, test warm, test the transition. Understand your hit rates. Quantify the actual improvement.

Sometimes caching is a 10x win. Sometimes it's marginal. You won't know until you test.
