Cloud-based load testing is convenient. Sign up, paste your URL, run tests from servers around the world. But there's a tradeoff people don't always think about: your test data goes through someone else's infrastructure.

For some tests, that's fine. For others, it's a problem.

## What you're sending

When you run a load test, you're not just sending a URL. You're often sending authentication tokens, API keys, session data. Your test requests might include realistic payloads with actual data structures. The responses contain whatever your API returns.

All of that flows through the testing service's servers. They probably have good security. They probably don't look at your data. But "probably" isn't always good enough.

## When it matters

Testing internal APIs that aren't publicly accessible. You'd have to expose them to the internet for a cloud service to reach them. That's a security risk you might not want to take.

Testing with production-like credentials. If your load test uses real API keys or tokens, those credentials now exist on external servers.

Compliance requirements. Some industries have rules about where data can go. Healthcare, finance, government. Cloud testing might violate those rules.

Simple paranoia. Maybe you just don't want your API structure and responses sitting on someone else's servers. That's valid too.

## The local alternative

Local-first tools run entirely on your machine. Zoyla is built this way. No cloud account, no data upload, no external servers involved. Your test configuration, your requests, your results — all stay on your computer.

You can test internal services without exposing them. Your credentials never leave your machine. Compliance is simpler because data doesn't go anywhere.

The tradeoff is you're limited to the load your machine can generate. For testing APIs during development, that's usually plenty. For simulating massive distributed attacks, you'd need something else. The [free load testing tools](/resources/free-load-testing-tools) guide covers other options.

## Practical benefits

Beyond security, there are practical advantages.

No account creation. No subscription management. No wondering if you're within free tier limits.

Works offline. Testing against local development servers doesn't require internet access.

Faster iteration. No waiting for cloud infrastructure to spin up. Run a test, see results, adjust, repeat.

For the [simple load testing setup](/resources/simple-load-testing-setup) most developers need, local tools are often the better fit.

## When cloud makes sense

If you need to test from multiple geographic locations, cloud services have an advantage. Your machine is in one place. Cloud services can run tests from servers worldwide.

If you need to generate more load than a single machine can produce, distributed cloud testing handles that.

If you're testing public APIs and don't care about data exposure, cloud services are convenient.

## Making the choice

Think about what you're testing. Internal or public? Sensitive data or not? How much load do you actually need? The [load testing staging environment](/resources/load-testing-staging-environment) guide covers environment setup in more detail.

For most API development and testing, local tools handle the job. Save the cloud services for when you specifically need their capabilities.

The [desktop vs CLI comparison](/resources/desktop-vs-cli-load-testing) covers more about local tool options.

Your data, your machine, your control. Sometimes that's exactly what you need.
